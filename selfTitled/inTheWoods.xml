    [Verse 1]
    My head was warm
    My skin was soaked
    I called your name 'til the fever broke
    When I awoke
    The moon still hung
    The night so black that the darkness hums
    
    [Verse 2]
    I raised myself
    My legs were weak
    I prayed my mind be good to me
    An awful noise
    Filled the air
    I heard a scream in the woods somewhere
    
    [Chorus]
    Ooh, oo-ooh, oo-ooh
    
    [Verse 3]
    A woman's voice
    I quickly ran
    Into the trees with empty hands
    A fox it was
    He shook afraid
    I spoke no words, no sound he made
    
    [Verse 4]
    His bone exposed
    His hind was lame
    I raised a stone to end his pain
    What caused the wound?
    How large the teeth?
    I saw new eyes were watching me
    
    [Chorus]
    Ooh, oo-ooh, oo-ooh
    
    [Verse 5]
    The creature lunged
    I turned and ran
    To save a life I didn't have
    Dear, in the chase
    There as I flew
    Forgot all prayers of joining you
    
    [Verse 6]
    I clutched my life
    And wished it kept
    My dearest love, I'm not done yet
    How many years
    I know I'll bear
    I found something in the woods somewhere
    
    [Chorus]
    Ooh, oo-ooh, oo-ooh
