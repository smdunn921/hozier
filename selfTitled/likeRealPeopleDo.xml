        <section type="Verse" n="1">
            <line>I had a thought, dear, however scary</line>
            <line>About that night, the bugs and the dirt</line>
            <line>Why were you digging? What did you bury</line>
            <line>Before those hands pulled me from the earth?</line>
        </section>
    
        <section type="Chorus">
            <line>I will not ask you where you came from</line>
            <line>I will not ask and neither should you</line>
            <line>Honey, just put your sweet lips on my lips</line>
            <line>We should just kiss like real people do</line>
        </section>
    
        <section type="Verse" n="2">
            <line>I knew that look, dear: eyes always seeking</line>
            <line>Was there in someone that dug long ago</line>
            <line>So I will not ask you why you were creeping</line>
            <line>In some sad way, I already know</line>

        <section type="Chorus">
            <line>So I will not ask you where you came from</line>
            <line>I would not ask and neither would you</line>
            <line>Honey, just put your sweet lips on my lips</line>
            <line>We should just kiss like real people do</line>
        </section>
    
        <section type="Chorus">
            <line>I could not ask you where you came from</line>
            <line>I could not ask and neither could you</line>
            <line>Honey, just put your sweet lips on my lips</line>
            <line>We could just kiss like real people do</line>
