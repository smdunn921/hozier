    [Verse 1]
    Just a little rush, babe, to feel dizzy
    To derail the mind of me
    Just a little hush, babe; my veins are busy
    But my heart's in atrophy
    
    [Pre-Chorus]
    Any way
    To distract and sedate
    Adding shadows
    To the walls of the cave
    
    [Chorus 1]
    You and I, nursing on a
    Poison that never stung
    Our teeth and lungs are lined
    With the scum of it
    Somewhere for this, death and guns
    We are deaf, we are numb
    Free and young and we
    Can feel none of it
    
    [Verse 2]
    Something isn't right, babe; I keep catching
    Little words, but the meaning's thin
    I'm somewhere outside my life, babe; I keep scratching
    But somehow I can't get in
    
    [Pre-Chorus]
    So we're slaves
    To any semblance of touch
    Lord, we should quit
    But we love it too much
    
    [Chorus 2]
    Sedated, we're nursing on a
    Poison that never stung
    Our teeth and lungs are lined
    With the scum of it
    Somewhere for this, death and guns
    We are deaf, we are numb
    Free and young and we
    Can feel none of it
    
    [Bridge]
    Darlin', don't you
    Stand there watching, won't you
    Come and save me from it?
    Darlin', don't you
    Join in, you're supposed to
    Drag me away from it
    
    [Pre-Chorus]
    Any way
    To distract and sedate
    Adding shadows
    To the walls of the cave
    
    [Chorus 1]
    You and I, nursing on a
    Poison that never stung
    Our teeth and lungs are lined
    With the scum of it
    Somewhere for this, death and guns
    We are deaf, we are numb
    Free and young and we
    Can feel none of it
    
    [Chorus 2]
    Sedated, we're nursing on a
    Poison that never stung
    Our teeth and lungs are lined
    With the scum of it
    Somewhere for this, death and guns
    We are deaf, we are numb
    Free and young and we
    Can feel none of it
