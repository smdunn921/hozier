    [Humming]
    
    [Verse 1]
    When I was a child, I heard voices
    Some would sing and some would scream
    You soon find you have few choices
    I learned the voices died with me
    When I was a child, I'd sit for hours
    Staring into open flame
    Something in it had a power
    Could barely tear my eyes away
    
    [Hook]
    All you have is your fire
    And the place you need to reach
    Don't you ever tame your demons
    But always keep them on a leash
    
    [Humming]
    
    [Verse 2]
    When I was sixteen, my senses fooled me
    Thought gasoline was on my clothes
    I knew that something would always rule me
    I knew this scent was mine alone
    
    [Hook]
    All you have is your fire
    And the place you need to reach
    Don't you ever tame your demons
    Always keep them on a leash
    
    [Bridge]
    When I was a man, I thought it ended
    When I knew love's perfect ache
    But my peace has always depended
    On all the ashes in my wake
    
    [Outro]
    All you have is your fire
    And the place you need to reach
    Don't you ever tame your demons
    But always keep them on a leash
