        <section type="Verse" n="1">
            <line>I couldn't utter my love when it counted</line>
            <line>Ah, but I'm <natureRef>singing like a bird</natureRef> 'bout it now</line>
            <line>And I couldn't whisper when you needed it shouted</line>
            <line>Ah, but I'm <natureRef>singing like a bird</natureRef> 'bout it now</line>
        </section>

        <section type="Chorus" n="1">
            <line>Words hung above, but never would form</line>
            <line>Like a cry at the <natureRef>final breath that is drawn</natureRef></line>
            <line>Remember me, love, when I'm reborn</line>
            <line>As a <natureRef>shrike</natureRef> to your sharp and glorious thorn</line>
        </section>

        <section type="Verse" n="2">
            <line>I'd no idea on what ground I was founded</line>
            <line>All of that goodness is going with you now</line>
            <line>Then when I met you, my virtues uncounted</line>
            <line>All of my goodness is going with you now</line>
        </section>

        <section type="Chorus" n="2">
            <line>Dragging along, follow in your form</line>
            <line>Hung like the <natureRef>pelt</natureRef> of some <natureRef>prey</natureRef> you
                had worn</line>
            <line>Remember me, love, when I'm reborn</line>
            <line>As the <natureRef>shrike</natureRef> to your sharp and glorious thorn</line>
        </section>

        <section type="Verse" n="3">
            <line>I fled to the city with so much discounted</line>
            <line>Ah, but I'm <natureRef>flying like a bird</natureRef> to you now</line>
            <line>Back to the <natureRef>hedgerows</natureRef> where <natureRef>bodies are
                    mounted</natureRef></line>
            <line>Ah, but I'm flying like a bird to you now</line>
        </section>

        <section type="Chorus" n="3">
            <line>I was housed by your warmth, thus transformed</line>
            <line>By your grounded and giving and darkening scorn</line>
            <line>Remember me, love, when I'm reborn</line>
            <line>As the <natureRef>shrike</natureRef> to your sharp and glorious thorn</line>
