    <section type="Verse" n="1">
    I would shun the light, share in evening's cool and quiet
    Who would trade that hum of night
    For sunlight, sunlight, sunlight
    But whose heart would not take flight?
    <mythRef>Betray the moon as acolyte</mythRef>
    On first and fierce affirming sight
    Of sunlight, sunlight, sunlight
    </section>
    
    <section type="Chorus">
    I had been lost to you, sunlight
    And flew like a moth to you, sunlight, oh, sunlight
    Oh, your love is sunlight
    Oh, your love is sunlight, oh
    But it is sunlight
    </section>
    
    <section type="Verse" n="2">
    All the tales the same
    Told before and told again
    A soul that's born in cold and rain
    Knows sunlight, sunlight, sunlight
    And at last can grant a name
    To a buried and a burning flame
    As love and its decisive pain
    Oh, my sunlight, sunlight, sunlight
    </section>
    
    <section type="Chorus">
    All that was shown to me, sunlight
    Was somethin' foreknown to me, sunlight, oh sunlight
    Oh, your love is sunlight
    Oh, your love is sunlight
    But it is sunlight
    Oh, your love is sunlight
    Oh, your love is sunlight
    But it is sunlight, sunlight
    </section>
    
    <section type="Bridge">
    Oh, all these colors fade for you only
    Hold me, carry me slowly, my sunlight
    Oh, all these colors fade for you only
    Hold me, carry me slowly, my sunlight
    
    </section>
    <section type="Verse" n="3">
    Each day, you'd rise with me
    Know that I would gladly be
    The <mythRef>Icarus</mythRef> to your certainty
    Oh, my sunlight, sunlight, sunlight
    <mythRef>Strap the wing to me
    Death trap clad happily
    With wax melted, I'd meet the sea</mythRef>
    Under sunlight, sunlight, sunlight
    </section>
    
    <section type="Chorus">
    Oh, your love is sunlight
    Oh, your love is sunlight
    But it is sunlight
    Oh, your love is sunlight
    Oh, your love is sunlight
    But it is sunlight
    Oh, your love is sunlight
    Oh, your love is sunlight
    But it is sunlight
    Oh, your love is sunlight
    Oh, your love is sunlight
    But it is sunlight
    </section>
    
    <section type="Outro">
    Sunlight, sunlight, sunlight, sunlight, sunlight
