        <section type="Verse " n="1">
        I'd be the voice that urged <mythRef>Orpheus</mythRef>
        When her body was found (Hey, yeah)
        I'd be the choiceless hope in grief
        That drove him <mythRef>underground</mythRef> (Hey, yeah)
        I'd be the dreadful need in the devotee
        That made him <mythRef>turn around</mythRef> (Hey, yeah)
        And I'd be the immediate forgiveness
        In <mythRef>Eurydice</mythRef>
        Imagine being loved by me
        </section>
        
        <section type="Chorus">
        I won't deny I've got in my mind now (Hey, yeah)
        All the things I would do
        So I try to talk refined for fear that you find out (Hey, yeah)
        How I'm imaginin' you
        </section>
        
        <section type="Verse " n="2">
        I'd be the last shred of truth
        In the lost myth of true love (Hey, yeah)
        I'd be the sweet feeling of release
        Mankind now dreams of (Hey, yeah)
        That's found in the last witness
        Before the wave hits, marvelling at <religRef>God</religRef> (Hey, yeah)
        Before he feels alone one final time and marries the sea
        Imagine being loved by me
        </section>
        
        <section type="Chorus">
        I won't deny I've got in my mind now (Hey, yeah)
        All the things I would do
        So I try to talk refined for fear that you find out (Hey, yeah)
        How I'm imaginin' you
        I won't deny I've got in my mind now (Hey, yeah)
        All the things we could do
        So I try to talk refined for fear that you find out (Hey, yeah)
        How I'm imaginin' you
