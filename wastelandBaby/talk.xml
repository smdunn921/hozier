        <section type="Verse" n="1">
            <line>I'd be the voice that urged <mythRef>Orpheus</mythRef></line>
            <line>When her body was found (Hey, yeah)</line>
            <line>I'd be the choiceless hope in grief</line>
            <line>That drove him <mythRef>underground</mythRef> (Hey, yeah)</line>
            <line>I'd be the dreadful need in the devotee</line>
            <line>That <mythRef>made him turn around</mythRef> (Hey, yeah)</line>
            <line>And I'd be the immediate forgiveness</line>
            <line>In <mythRef>Eurydice</mythRef></line>
            <line>Imagine being loved by me</line>

        <section type="Chorus">
            <line>I won't deny I've got in my mind now (Hey, yeah)</line>
            <line>All the things I would do</line>
            <line>So I try to talk refined for fear that you find out (Hey, yeah)</line>
            <line>How I'm imaginin' you</line>
        </section>

        <section type="Verse" n="2">
            <line>I'd be the last shred of truth</line>
            <line>In the lost myth of true love (Hey, yeah)</line>
            <line>I'd be the sweet feeling of release</line>
            <line>Mankind now dreams of (Hey, yeah)</line>
            <line>That's found in the last witness</line>
            <line>Before the wave hits, marvelling at <religRef>God</religRef> (Hey, yeah)</line>
            <line>Before he feels alone one final time and marries the sea</line>
            <line>Imagine being loved by me</line>

            <line>I won't deny I've got in my mind now (Hey, yeah)</line>
            <line>All the things we could do</line>
            <line>So I try to talk refined for fear that you find out (Hey, yeah)</line>
            <line>How I'm imaginin' you</line>
