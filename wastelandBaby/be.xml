            <line>When all the worst we fear lets fall its weight</line>
            <line>When the <litRef>gyre widens</litRef> on and when the wave breaks</line>
            <line>When <religRef type="person" id="St-Peter">St. Peter</religRef> loses cool and bars the gates</line>
            <line>When <mythRef type="person" id="Atlas">Atlas</mythRef> acts the maggot, makes his arms shake</line>
            <line>When the <natureRef>birds</natureRef> are heard again in their singin'</line>
            <line>Once atrocity is hoarse from voicin' shame</line>
            <line>And when the earth is trembling on some new beginnin'</line>
            <line>With the same sweet shock of when <religRef type="person" id="Adam">Adam</religRef> first came</line> <!--shd: im sorry i giggle at the final two lines of this first verse every time. "i figure that lad had an awful surprise on his hands is all" -hozier via twitter  -->

            <line>Be that hopeful feeling when <religRef>Eden was lost</religRef> (Lover, be good to me)</line>
            <line>It's been deaf to our laughter since the <religRef type="person" id="God">master</religRef> was crossed (Lover, be good to

            <line>Which side of the wall really suffers that cost?</line>
