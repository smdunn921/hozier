    [Verse 1]
    Honey, this club here is stuck up
    Dinner and diatribes
    I knew well from our first hookup
    The look of mischief in your eyes
    Your friends are a fate that befell me
    Hell is the talking type
    I'd suffer Hell if you'd tell me
    What you'd do to me tonight
    
    [Pre-Chorus]
    Tell me
    Tell me
    Tell me, ah
    
    [Chorus]
    That's the kind of love
    I've been dreaming of
    That's the kind of love
    I've been dreaming of
    
    [Verse 2]
    Honey, I laugh when it sinks in
    A pillar I am, upright
    Scarcely can speak for my thinking
    What you'd do to me tonight
    Now that the evening is slowing
    Now that the end's in sight
    Honey, it's easier knowing what you'd do to me tonight
    
    [Pre-Chorus]
    Tell me
    Tell me
    Tell your man
    
    [Chorus]
    That's the kind of love
    I've been dreaming of
    That's the kind of love
    I've been dreaming of
    
    [Bridge]
    (That's the kind of love
    That's the kind of love
    That's the kind of love
    That's the kind of love)
    Oh, let there be hotel complaints and grievances raised
    And that kind of love
    (That's the kind of love
    That's the kind of love
    That's the kind of love
    That's the kind of love)
    Oh, let there be damage ensued and tabloid news
    And that kind of love
    (That's the kind of love
    That's the kind of love
    That's the kind of love
    That's the kind of love)
    That's the kind of love
    I've been dreaming of
    Ah, oh-oh-oh, ah
    
    [Chorus]
    That's the kind of love
    I've been dreaming of
    And that's the kind of love
    I've been dreaming of
