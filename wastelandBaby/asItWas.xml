        <section type="Verse" n="1">
            <line>There is a roadway, muddy and <natureRef>foxgloved</natureRef></line>
            <line>Whenever I'd have life enough, my heart is screamin' of</line>
            <line>And in a few days I would be there, love</line>
            <line>Whatever here that's left of me is yours just as it was</line>
        </section>

        <section type="Chorus">
            <line>Just as it was, baby</line>
            <line>Before the otherness came</line>
            <line>And I knew its name</line>
            <line>The drug, the dark, the light, the flame</line>
        </section>

        <section type="Verse" n="2">
            <line>The highs hit the heights of my baby</line>
            <line>And its hold had the fight of my baby</line>
            <line>And the lights were as bright as my baby</line>
            <line>But your love was unmoved</line>
        </section>

        <section type="Bridge">
            <line>Tell me if somehow, some of it remains</line>
            <line>How long you would wait for me?</line>
            <line>And how long I've been away</line>
            <line>The shape that I'm in now, your shape in the doorway</line>
            <line>Make your good love known to me</line>
            <line>Or just tell me 'bout your day</line>
        </section>

        <section type="Chorus">
            <line>Just as it was, baby</line>
            <line>Before the otherness came</line>
            <line>And I knew its name</line>
            <line>The drug, the dark, the light, the shame</line>
        </section>

        <section type="Outro">
            <line>The highs hit the heights of my baby</line>
            <line>And its hold had the fight of my baby</line>
            <line>And the lights were as bright as my baby</line>
            <line>But your love was unmoved</line>
            <line>And the sights were as stark as my baby</line>
            <line>And the cold cut as sharp as my baby</line>
            <line>And the nights were as dark as my baby</line>
            <line>And half as beautiful too</line>
