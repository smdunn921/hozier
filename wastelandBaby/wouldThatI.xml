            <line>True that I saw her hair like the <natureRef element="earth" type="tree">branch</natureRef> of a
                tree</line>
            <line>A <natureRef element="earth" type="tree">willow</natureRef> dancing on <natureRef
                element="air">air</natureRef> before covering me</line>
            <line>Under cotton and calicoes</line>
            <line>Over canopy dappled long ago</line>
            <line>True that love in withdrawal was the weepin' of me</line>
            <line>That the sound of the saw must be known by the <natureRef element="earth" type="tree"
                >tree</natureRef></line>
            <line>Must be felled for to fight the cold</line>
            <line>Fretted <natureRef element="fire">fire</natureRef> but that was
                long ago</line>

            <line>It's not tonight (Oh, oh)</line>
            <line>Where I'm set alight (Oh, oh)</line>
            <line>And I blink in sight (Oh, oh)</line>
            <line>Of your blinding light (Oh, oh)</line>
            <line>Oh, it's not tonight (Oh, oh)</line>
            <line>Where you hold me tight (Oh, oh)</line>
            <line>And the <natureRef element="fire">fire</natureRef> bright (Oh,
                oh)</line>
            <line>Oh, let it blaze alright (Oh, oh)</line>
            <line>Oh, but you're good to me, oh, you're good to me (Oh, oh)</line>
            <line>Oh, but that you're good to me, baby (Oh, oh)</line>

            <line>With the roar of the <natureRef element="fire">fire</natureRef>, my
                heart rose to its feet</line>
            <line>Like the ashes of ash, I saw rise in the heat</line>
            <line>Settled soft and as pure as <natureRef  element="water" type="snow"
                >snow</natureRef></line>
            <line>I fell in love with the <natureRef element="fire">fire</natureRef>
                long ago</line>
            <line>With each love I cut loose, I was never the same</line>
            <line>Watching still-living <natureRef element="earth" type="root">roots</natureRef> be consumed by the
                <natureRef element="fire">flame</natureRef></line>
            <line>I was fixed on your hand of gold</line>
            <line>Layin' waste to my lovin' long ago</line>

            <line>So in awe, there I stood as you licked off the grain</line>
